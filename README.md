# YouTube Bass Cover No-Bass Remover

## 🛠 Features
- Download bass cover videos from YouTube.
- Extract the audio and remove only the bass track while keeping vocals, drums, and other instruments.
- Recombine the video with the modified audio, creating a no-bass practice track with the original video’s tablature.
